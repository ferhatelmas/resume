\vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increase data processing capacity 3 times and speed \texttildelow 20 times by using correct data store, where previous one was very slow for our relational data and required ad-hoc queries for search engine (main feature).
  \item Ditched NoSQL as main store but it doesn't mean it's removed completely from architecture. Even utilised more in specific tasks such as task runner, sessions, output caching and tests.
  \item Reworked front-end build for 2 times faster and 40\% smaller bundles, which is also helping us for ES6 transition.
  \item Implemented framework to integrate data of different ground operation companies, which is currently used for 4 companies to enable 2 main supportive features for cash price search engine.
  \item Implemented robust payment system via Stripe, which is replacing manual invoices. Currently, brings more money than previous manual system without any effort.
  \item Brought analysis and charts to expose historical data which create additional dimension in the usefulness of website.
  \item Designed and implemented admin console to automate / control administrative tasks easily. It provides better insights, easier data manipulation and tracking, full automation on tools / services  (i.e. Asana, Sendgrid, Stripe, Twitter, etc.) where it's main ingredient while building growth plan.
